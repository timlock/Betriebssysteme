        Regressions are no fun; among other things, finding the source of a
regression among thousands of changes can be a needle-in-the-haystack sort
of problem.  The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect"><tt>git
bisect</tt></a> 
command can help; it is a (relatively) easy way to sift through 
large numbers of commits to find the one that introduces a regression.  When it
works well, it can quickly point out the change that causes a specific
problem.  Bisection is not a perfect tool, though; it can go badly wrong in
situations where a bug cannot be reliably reproduced.  In an attempt to
make bisection more useful in such cases, Jan Kara is proposing to <a
href="/ml/git/20211118164940.8818-1-jack@suse.cz/">add "stochastic
bisection" support</a> to Git.

        The Spectre class of vulnerabilities was given that name because, it was
thought, these problems would haunt us for a long time.  As the fourth
anniversary of <a href="/Articles/742702/">the disclosure of Meltdown and
Spectre</a> approaches, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of that
name.  One of 
the more recent Spectre variants goes by the name "straight-line
speculation"; it was first disclosed in June 2020, but fixes are still
trying to find their way into the compilers and the kernel.

        Feature deprecations are often controversial, but many projects find it
necessary, or desirable, to lose some of the baggage that has accreted over
time.  A mid-November request to get rid of three Python standard library
modules provides a case in point.  It was initially greeted as a good idea
since the modules had been officially deprecated starting with
Python&nbsp;3.6; there are better ways to accomplish their
tasks now.  But, of course, removing a module breaks any project that uses
it, at least without the project making some, perhaps even trivial,
changes.  The cost of that is not insignificant, and the value in doing so
is not always clear, which led to higher-level conversation about deprecations.

        The Linux random-number generator (RNG) seems to attract an <a
href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Random_numbers">outsized amount 
of attention</a> (and work) for what is, or seemingly should be, a fairly small
component of the kernel.  In part that is because random numbers, and
their quality, are extremely important to a number of security
protections, from unpredictable IP-packet sequence numbers to cryptographic
keys.  A recent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/2036923.9o76ZdvQCi@positron.chronox.de/">post</a> of
version&nbsp;43 of the Linux Random Number 
Generator (LRNG) by Stephan Müller is not likely to go any further than its
predecessors, but the discussion around it may lead to support for a
feature that some distributions need.

        Reference counts are a commonly used mechanism for tracking the life cycle
of objects in a computing system.  As long as every user of an object
correctly maintains its references by incrementing and decrementing the
reference count, that object will persist for as long as it
is needed
and will be properly destroyed once the last user is done.  The "correctly"
in that sentence is important, though; things do not work
as well in the presence of reference-counting errors.  Networking
developer Eric Dumazet is working on <a href="/ml/netdev/20211205042217.982127-1-eric.dumazet@gmail.com/">a
reference-count tracking system</a> that could prove useful for finding
these errors in the networking subsystem and, someday, throughout the kernel.

        It is natural, when looking at the kernel development process, to focus on
patches that find their way to acceptance and become a part of future
kernels.  But there can be value in looking at work that doesn't clear the
bar; in failing, these patches often reveal things about the kernel and the
community that creates it.  Such is the case with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211118181210.281359-1-y.karadz@gmail.com/">proof-of-concept
namespacefs
patch series</a> recently posted by Yordan Karadzhov.  One should not
expect to see namespacefs in a future kernel but, in failing, this work
showed a real use case and why it is hard to satisfy that use case in the
kernel.

        Writing (correct) concurrent code that uses locking to avoid race
conditions is difficult enough.  When the objective is to use <a
href="/Articles/844224/">lockless algorithms</a>, relying on memory
barriers instead of locks to eliminate locking overhead, the problem
becomes harder 
still.  Bugs are easy to create and hard to find in this type of code.
There may be some help on the way, though, in the form of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211130114433.2580590-1-elver@google.com/">this
patch set</a> from Marco Elver that enhances the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kcsan.html">Kernel
Concurrency 
Sanitizer</a> (KCSAN) with  the ability to detect some types of missing
memory barriers.

        A seemingly straightforward question aimed at candidates for the in-progress
<a
href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/f35-elections-voting-now-open/">Fedora
elections</a> led to a discussion on the Fedora devel mailing list that
branched into a few different directions.  The question was related to a
struggle that the distribution has had before: whether using non-free Git
forges is appropriate.  One of the
differences this time, though, is that the focus is on where <a
href="https://packit.dev/docs/source-git/">source-git</a> (or src-git)
repositories will be hosted, which is a separate question from where the <a
href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dist-git">dist-git repository</a>
lives.

	Consider, for example, the case of a service provider who would

	roles, drop old ones, change permissions on objects that they don't
	own, and generally enjoy the freedom to bypass permission checks at
	the SQL level which superusers enjoy. The service provider, who is
	the true superuser, also wants this, but does not want the
	customers to be able to do the really scary things that a superuser
	can do, like changing archive_command to
	<tt>rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;/</tt> or deleting the
