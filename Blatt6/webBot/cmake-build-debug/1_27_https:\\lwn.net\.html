        Reference counts are a commonly used mechanism for tracking the life cycle
of objects in a computing system.  As long as every user of an object
correctly maintains its references by incrementing and decrementing the
reference count, that object will persist for as long as it
is needed
and will be properly destroyed once the last user is done.  The "correctly"
in that sentence is important, though; things do not work
as well in the presence of reference-counting errors.  Networking
developer Eric Dumazet is working on <a href="/ml/netdev/20211205042217.982127-1-eric.dumazet@gmail.com/">a
reference-count tracking system</a> that could prove useful for finding
these errors in the networking subsystem and, someday, throughout the kernel.

        It is natural, when looking at the kernel development process, to focus on
patches that find their way to acceptance and become a part of future
kernels.  But there can be value in looking at work that doesn't clear the
bar; in failing, these patches often reveal things about the kernel and the
community that creates it.  Such is the case with the <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211118181210.281359-1-y.karadz@gmail.com/">proof-of-concept
namespacefs
patch series</a> recently posted by Yordan Karadzhov.  One should not
expect to see namespacefs in a future kernel but, in failing, this work
showed a real use case and why it is hard to satisfy that use case in the
kernel.

        Writing (correct) concurrent code that uses locking to avoid race
conditions is difficult enough.  When the objective is to use <a
href="/Articles/844224/">lockless algorithms</a>, relying on memory
barriers instead of locks to eliminate locking overhead, the problem
becomes harder 
still.  Bugs are easy to create and hard to find in this type of code.
There may be some help on the way, though, in the form of <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211130114433.2580590-1-elver@google.com/">this
patch set</a> from Marco Elver that enhances the <a

Sanitizer</a> (KCSAN) with  the ability to detect some types of missing

        A seemingly straightforward question aimed at candidates for the in-progress
<a
href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/f35-elections-voting-now-open/">Fedora
elections</a> led to a discussion on the Fedora devel mailing list that
branched into a few different directions.  The question was related to a
struggle that the distribution has had before: whether using non-free Git
forges is appropriate.  One of the
differences this time, though, is that the focus is on where <a
href="https://packit.dev/docs/source-git/">source-git</a> (or src-git)
repositories will be hosted, which is a separate question from where the <a
href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dist-git">dist-git repository</a>
lives.

        While there are few rules on the names of variables, classes, functions,
and so on (i.e. identifiers) in the Python language, there are some
guidelines on how those things should be named.   But, of course, those
guidelines were not always followed in 
the standard library, especially in the early years of the project.  A
suggestion to add aliases to the standard library for
identifiers that do not follow the guidelines seems highly unlikely to go
anywhere, but it led to an interesting 
discussion on the python-ideas mailing list.

        One of the key features of the extended BPF virtual machine is the verifier
built into the kernel that ensures that all BPF programs are safe to run.
BPF developers often see the verifier as a bit of a mixed blessing, though;
while it can catch a lot of problems before they happen, it can also be
hard to please.  Comparisons with a well-meaning but rule-bound and picky
bureaucracy would not be entirely misplaced.  The <a
href="/ml/bpf/20211123183409.3599979-1-joannekoong@fb.com/"><tt>bpf_loop()</tt>
proposal</a> from Joanne Koong is an attempt to make pleasing the BPF
bureaucrats a bit easier for one type of loop construct.

        One does not normally expect a lot of disagreement over a 13-line patch
that effectively tweaks a single line of code.  Occasionally, though, such
a patch can expose a disagreement over how the behavior of the kernel
should be managed.  <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211028080813.15966-1-sir@cmpwn.com/">This patch
from Drew DeVault</a>, who is evidently taking a break from <a
href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Cash-for-leftpad.html">stirring up
the npm community</a>, is a case in point.  It brings to light the question
of how  the kernel community should pick default values for configurable
parameters like resource limits.

        The kernel provides a number of macros internally to allow code to generate
warnings when something goes wrong.  It does not, however, provide a lot of
guidance regarding what should happen when a warning is issued.  Alexander
Popov recently posted <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20211027233215.306111-1-alex.popov@linux.com/">a
patch series</a> adding an option for the system's response to warnings;
that series seems unlikely to be applied in anything close to its current
form, but it did succeed in provoking a discussion on how warnings should
be handled.

        The CentOS blog has <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2021/12/introducing-centos-stream-9/">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://centos.org/stream9/">CentOS Stream&nbsp;9</a>:
<blockquote class="bq">
CentOS Stream is a continuous-delivery distribution providing each point-release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Before a package is formally introduced to CentOS Stream, it undergoes a battery of tests and checks—both automated and manual—to ensure it meets the stringent standards for inclusion in RHEL. Updates posted to Stream are identical to those posted to the unreleased minor version of RHEL. The aim? For CentOS Stream to be as fundamentally stable as RHEL itself.
<p>
To achieve this stability, each major release of Stream starts from a stable release of Fedora Linux—In CentOS Stream 9, this begins with Fedora 34, which is the same code base from which RHEL 9 is built. As updated packages pass testing and meet standards for stability, they are pushed into CentOS Stream as well as the nightly build of RHEL.

        Over on the Project Zero blog, Tavis Ormandy has a <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/this-shouldnt-have-happened.html">lengthy postmortem</a> on a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-51/">vulnerability</a> that he found in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Overview">Network Security Services</a> (NSS) cryptography library.  The vulnerability is a bog-standard buffer overflow that has existed in the library since 2012 despite various kinds of static analysis, testing, and fuzzing that Mozilla and others have applied to it over the years.  He found it with a new fuzzing technique:
<blockquote class="bq">
To solve this problem, I’ve been experimenting with monitoring the call stack during execution.
<p>
The naive implementation is too slow to be practical, but after a lot of optimization I had come up with a library that was fast enough to be integrated into coverage-guided fuzzing, and was testing how it performed with NSS and other libraries.
<p>
[...] The fuzzer I was using is able to isolate and extract interesting new ASN.1 OIDs, SEQUENCEs, INTEGERs, and so on. Once extracted, it can then randomly combine or insert them into template data. This isn’t really a new idea, but is a new implementation. I'm planning to open source this code in the future.

<h2 class="Headline">SFC: First Update on the Vizio lawsuit</h2>

        The Software Freedom Conservancy <a
href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/nov/30/vizio-update-0/">provides
an update</a> on its <a href="/Articles/873338/">suit against Vizio</a> for
copyleft license violations.  Vizio's response was not to release the
source code:
<blockquote class="bq">
Instead, Vizio <a
href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808.1.0.pdf">filed
a request to "remove" the case from California State Court (into US federal
court)</a>, which indicates Vizio's belief that consumers have no
third-party beneficiary rights under <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/glossary.html#copyleft">copyleft</a>! In other words, Vizio’s
answer to this complaint is not to comply with the copyleft licenses, but instead imply that Software Freedom Conservancy — and all other purchasers of the devices who might want to assert their right under GPL and LGPL to complete, corresponding source — have no right to even ask for that source code.
